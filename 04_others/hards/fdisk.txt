fdisk:
    Is a (command-line utility) used for disk partitioning in various Linux distributions.
    
    It allows users to create, delete, and manipulate disk partitions on a storage device.
    
        Here are some common tasks that fdisk can help you with:

        1- Creating Partitions:
            You can use fdisk to (create new partitions) on a disk.

        2- Deleting Partitions:
            If you want to (remove a partition) from a disk, fdisk can help you delete it.

        3- Changing Partition Type:
            fdisk allows you to (change the type of a partition).
            For example, you can change a partition from a primary partition to an extended partition.

        4- Displaying Partition Information:
            You can use fdisk to (display information) about the existing partitions on a disk,
            such as their size, type, and the file system they use.

        5- Writing Changes to Disk:
            After making changes to the partition table, you need to write the changes to the disk.
            fdisk provides an option to save the changes.



Note:
    If you're not familiar with disk partitioning or if you need to perform more complex tasks,
    you might also consider using other tools like (parted) or (gparted), 
    which provide a more user-friendly interface for managing partitions. 

    Additionally, for modern systems that use the GUID Partition Table (GPT) instead of the older Master Boot Record (MBR),
    gdisk or gparted are often more suitable.
