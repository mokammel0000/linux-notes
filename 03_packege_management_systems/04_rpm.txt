RPM: 
    Stands for (Red Hat Package Manager).

    Used in Fedora, CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

    RPM is a low-level package management system 
        used for installing, uninstalling, upgrading, querying, and verifying software packages on a Linux system.

    It primarily deals with (individual packages in the form of .rpm files).

    RPM itself (does not resolve dependencies),
        so users may need to manually install dependencies for a package to work correctly.

    DNF and Yum use it as an Underlying tool.


    Commands: 
        sudo rpm -ivh __.rpm : to install an .rpm package (firstly download the package).
        sudo rpm -Uvh __.rpm : to upgrade the pakage before installing it.

        i: install 
        U: upgrade 
        v: verbose - give me details while installing the package.
        h: hashing - ### showing the % bar while installing.
