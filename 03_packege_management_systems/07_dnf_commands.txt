System Commands: 

    [sudo dnf --help]: List of main Commands. 

    [sudo dnf check-update]:
        used to check for available package updates without actually installing them.
        It provides a list of packages that have updates available.
        This is useful if you want to see what updates are pending before deciding to install them.

    [sudo dnf update]:
    [sudo dnf upgrade]:  (older alias)
        used to update all installed packages on your system to their latest versions.
        When you run sudo dnf update, DNF (Dandified Yum)
            checks for updates for all installed packages and installs the latest versions if available.
        It also resolves dependencies and ensures that your system is up to date with the latest software.

    [sudo dnf --refresh update]:
    [sudo dnf --refresh upgrade]:
        The --refresh option tells DNF 
            to check for the latest package information from the configured repositories before attempting the upgrade.
        It ensures that DNF has the latest metadata about available packages.
        So, this command not only upgrades packages but also refreshes the package information before doing so.


    [sudo dnf check]:
        check for and fix (broken dependencies),
        If there are any broken dependencies, you'll get a list of packages causing the issues.
        You can then try to fix them by reinstalling or removing the problematic packages.

    [sudo dnf autoremove]: 
        remove any orphaned packages (packages that were installed as dependencies but are no longer required)
