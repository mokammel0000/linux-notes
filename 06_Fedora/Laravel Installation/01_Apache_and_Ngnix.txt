Both Nginx and Apache are capable of (serving) Laravel applications,

The choice between them often depends on 
        -your specific requirements,
        -familiarity with the server,
        -and the characteristics of your application.

In some cases, developers choose to use both Nginx and Apache together in a setup called "Nginx as a reverse proxy for Apache."
    Nginx handles incoming requests and forwards dynamic content requests to Apache, which then processes them.
    This combination allows you to 
    leverage the performance benefits of Nginx while still benefiting from Apache's extensive module support.

A (LAMP) stack is a popular combination of open-source software that is used to power web applications.
It is composed of four main components: 
    -Linux operating system, 
    -(Apache) web server, 
    -MySQL relational database management system, 
    -PHP programming language.

Apache HTTP Server:
    A free and open-source web server software.
    plays a crucial role in serving web pages to users on the internet.
    known for its reliability and performance.

    [sudo dnf update]

    [rpm -q httpd]: 
        Check if the Apache package is installed.
    
    [sudo dnf install httpd]: 
        Installing Apache on fedora.

    [sudo systemctl status httpd]: 
        check if the Apache service is running.
    
    [sudo systemctl start httpd]: 
        Start the Apache service.
    
    [sudo systemctl enable httpd]: 
        Enable Apache to start on boot.

    [sudo systemctl restart httpd]: 
        Restart Apache.


    Enter (http://localhost) on a web browser to check if apache is enabled

Nginx: ( "engine-x")
    Nginx is a popular open-source web server, reverse proxy server, and load balancer. 
    is known for its high performance, stability, and scalability
    is widely used to serve static content
    is a popular choice for serving Laravel applications, and it's commonly recommended for several reasons:

    High Performance:
        Nginx is known for its high performance and low resource usage.
        Its event-driven architecture allows it to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.
        This can be beneficial for Laravel applications, especially in scenarios with high traffic.

    Simplicity: 
        Nginx's configuration syntax is often considered more straightforward and easier to work with compared to Apache.
        This simplicity can be advantageous when setting up and configuring your server for Laravel applications.

    Reverse Proxy: 
        Nginx can act as a reverse proxy server,
        forwarding requests from clients to other servers and returning the responses to clients.
        serving static content and forwarding dynamic requests to a backend server (e.g., PHP-FPM for Laravel applications).

    Load Balancing:
        Nginx can distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers
        to ensure optimal resource utilization and reliability.
    
    SSL/TLS Termination:
        It can handle SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, offloading this task from the web servers.

    HTTP Server:
        Nginx can serve static content directly, such as HTML, CSS, and images, reducing the load on application servers.

    Security Features:
        Nginx includes features to help secure web applications, such as access controls, secure connections, and rate limiting.

    Documentation and Community Support: 
        Nginx has extensive documentation and a large community,
        which can be beneficial when seeking help or finding resources for configuring and optimizing your server for Laravel.

    [sudo dnf update]

    [rpm -q nginx]: Check if the Nginx package is installed
    
    [sudo dnf install nginx]: Installing Nginx on fedora.
    
    [sudo systemctl status nginx]: Check the Nginx service status

    [sudo systemctl start nginx]: Start the Nginx service.

    [sudo systemctl enable nginx]: Enable Nginx to start on boot.

    [sudo systemctl restart nginx]: Restart Nginx.
