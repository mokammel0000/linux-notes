-MariaDB and MySQL packages (conflict) because they provide similar files.
    So, you can only install one of them, either MariaDB or MySQL, but not both.

-Install the necessary database server before installing PHP and its related packages,
    to ensure that any PHP packages requiring interaction with the database (like PDO extensions for MySQL or PostgreSQL)
    are installed correctly and can connect to the database server without issues.



[Update] your system before installation...

MySQL 8.0 community edition:

    https://www.tecmint.com/install-mysql-fedora-linux/
    https://tecadmin.net/install-mysql-57-on-fedora/
    https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/installing-mysql-mariadb/

    -you can Install mysql-server or mysql(the client virsion)
        Install MySQL client if you: 
            -need to connect to the MySQL server from another machine 
            -or use the MySQL command-line interface

    you can either install it from (Fedora Main Repo) or from (Oracle MySQL)
        -Fedora Main Repo: saves us from more complex steps.
        -Oracle MySQL Repo: provide the the most recent version of MySQL

    1- Mysql Installation:
        
        --Fedora Main Repo Installation:
            1- Install the service: 
                [sudo dnf install community-mysql-server] use it
                or [sudo dnf install mysql-server]

            2- start and enabel the service to use.
                [systemctl status mysqld]: Mysql will be in an inactive state after installation.
                [sudo systemctl start mysqld]: enabling MySQL service.
                [sudo systemctl enable mysqld]: to start MySQL at each boot.


        --Oracle Repo Installation: 
            1- download the repo from here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/yum/
            2- [sudo dnf install <path to downloaded rpm>]: to install the (repo) itself.
            3- [sudo dnf install mysql-community-server]: to install the (repo) itself.
            4- start and enabel the service to use.


    2- Securing MySQL in Fedora Linux:
        The default installation of MySQL is weak by modern standards of security and can easily be manipulated by hackers.
        There are multiple ways to secure your MySQL, but the simplest yet most effective is to use a secure script.

        Enter a new password for the service: I use the medium one: @Fabercastell0000
        -Remove anonymous users?: y
        -Disallow root login remotely?: n
        -Remove test database and access to it?: n
        -Reload privilege tables now?: y
        
    [sudo mysql -u root -p]: write the password of sudo then write the password for mysql service.
    SHOW DATABASES;
    

    3- other commands: 
    [sudo dnf update mysql-server]: to update it if there any updates in its repo.
    [sudo dnf remove community-mysql-server]
