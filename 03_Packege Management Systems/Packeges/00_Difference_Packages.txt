[Debian Package]: (.deb):
	-Commonly used by Debian-based distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, .....
	-The native package format for Debian-based Linux distributions(like ubuntu)
	-Software installed via .deb packages often has better integration with the system
	-use the APT package manager to install and manage .deb packages (sudo apt-get install firefox).
	

[Red Hat Package Manager]: (.rpm)
    -Commonly used by Red Hat-based distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Fedora.
    -Installed using the (rpm) command and managed by higher-level tools like (dnf and yum).


[Snap Package]:
	-Universal package format that can run on multiple Linux distributions,
	-Snaps contain their dependencies and run in sandboxed environments.
	-They are isolated from the system, which means they may not have as tight an integration with the host system as native packages.
	-use the Snap package manager, 'snap', to install and manage Snap packages (sudo snap install firefox).

	
[Flatpak Package]: 
	-Universal package format that can run on multiple Linux distributions,
	-Flatpaks contain their dependencies and run in sandboxed environments.
	-Flatpak applications have a higher degree of isolation from the host system, which can enhance (security).
	-use the Flatpak package manager to install and manage Flatpak packages (flatpak install flathub org.mozilla.Firefox).

[AppImage]:
    A format that provides a single, portable executable file for an application,
		which can run on different Linux distributions (without installation).
    AppImage files are self-contained and do not require a package manager.



=> Important Tip: 
If you want the best integration and performance on Ubuntu, use the native [Debian package],
Snaps and Flatpaks provide more universal packaging solutions
	that can be beneficial for running applications on different Linux distributions and ensuring (security and isolation).
