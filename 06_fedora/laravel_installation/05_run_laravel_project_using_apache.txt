sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd



you'll need to configure Apache to serve your Laravel project directory



Create a virtual host configuration file for your Laravel project. You can do this by creating a new Apache configuration file in the /etc/httpd/conf.d/ directory. For example:
sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/lara-shop.conf




Add the following configuration, replacing your-project with the name of your Laravel project directory:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName your-project.local
    DocumentRoot /path/to/your-project/public

    <Directory /path/to/your-project/public>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>



















sudo systemctl restart httpd
